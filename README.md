# GeminiFreeCAD
A Macro for FreeCAD that allows the user to communicate with Gemini API to produce 3D Models from text desctriptions.

## Installation

### Automatic Installation
1. Download and unzip the GeminiFreeCAD package
2. Run `install.py` (double-click or run with Python)
3. The script will automatically copy the macro to your FreeCAD Macro directory

### Manual Installation
If automatic installation fails:
1. Locate your FreeCAD Macro directory:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\FreeCAD\Macro`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD/Macro`
   - Linux: `~/.FreeCAD/Macro`
2. Copy `GeminiFreeCAD.FCMacro` to this directory

## Getting a Free Google Gemini API Key

1. Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) (sign in with your Google account)
2. Click on "Get API key" in the left sidebar
3. Either:
   - Select an existing project, or
   - Create a new project (click "+ Create a new project")
4. Click "Create API key"
5. Copy your new API key for use in the GeminiFeedbackCAD macro
6. Note: Google's free tier currently includes up to 60 requests per minute, which is more than sufficient for casual use

## Usage
1. In FreeCAD, go to Macro â†’ Macros...
2. Select "GeminiFreeCAD" and click "Execute"
3. Enter your Google Cloud API key
4. Type a description of what you want to create
5. Click "Generate" to create the model
6. Add suggestions in the feedback field and click "Improve" to refine the model

## Requirements
- FreeCAD 1.0.0 or newer
- Google Cloud API key with Gemini API access

## No Download WebPage Interface: https://txt2cad.streamlit.app/
This is an alternative to downloading the FreeCad Macro gemini interface. In this webpage we write all prompts and feedback to a MongoDB database with the hopes of fine-tuning an LLM for CAD generation in the future. All code must be copied from the webpage to a FreeCAD macro.

Outline for the app:
1. Optional: Select a generative model
2. Optional: Enter your own Google AI Studio API key below or use our shared API key. Our shared API key will be subject to rate limitiations with all other webpage users.
3. Provide specifciations for a CAD model to the LLM assistant in the box below (e.g. Scandanavian Table) then click 'Generate Code'. The generated code can then be pasted in a FreeCAD Macro and executed. 
4. Paste the generated code in a FreeCAD Macro and execute.
5. Provide revision feedback to the AI agent to improve or modify the original code.
6. Keep revising (5) or refresh and generate a new design.
